# 📺 improve-deeplearning-ai-screen-ratio
Ah, the joys of learning from the Andrew Ng, only to have half the screen go AWOL when you're trying to code and watch simultaneously. Because, apparently, multitasking is an art lost to responsive design.

So here I am, stepping in to save humanity (or at least myself) from this tragedy. Behold, the masterpiece.

## 🌟 What This Does

Ensures the video doesn't mysteriously crop itself like it's auditioning for a modern art exhibit.
Makes coding alongside the video slightly less rage-inducing. 

## 🛠️ How It Works
Honestly, it’s not rocket science, but it is screen ratio science. A few lines of code to save the day. Simple. Effective. Genius™ (in my head, at least).

## 🧑‍🔬 For Andrew (If You’re Reading This)
Andrew, my dear friend (we’re not, but it feels personal at this point), please hire someone 🙋‍♂️ to fix this so the world doesn’t have to depend on my coding "chef-d'œuvre".


## 📝 Disclaimer
I’m trying to learn AI. And honestly, I just needed to fill out this README to feel like a responsible coder. If this makes you smile—or cry—then my job here is done.

Feel free to paste this and adjust as you see fit! 😊
